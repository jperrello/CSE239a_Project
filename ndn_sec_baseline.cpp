/*
 * This example demonstrates a baseline NDN consumer application that:
 *   - Expresses an Interest for named data (e.g., "/example/testApp/data")
 *   - Receives a Data packet from the network
 *   - Verifies the Data packet's signature using NDNâ€™s built-in security (KeyChain)
 *
 * Aspects of this Implementation:
 *  - Named Data: Data is identified and requested by its name rather than by an endpoint address.
 *  - Interest and Data Packets: The core NDN packet types.
 *  - Built-in Security: Each Data packet is signed. The KeyChain component is used to verify the signature.
 *     -https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/secb0694df1a/1/web/1 for more info on keychain
 *
 * This baseline:
 *  - Illustrates how data packets can be fetched and verified.
 *  - Shows where and how trust management mechanisms (like additional key fetching or policy checks)
 *    would be integrated if the default trust model does not suffice.
 *
 *  - The ndn-cxx library handles many low-level details for us. In advanced applications,
 *    we may want to override or extend these behaviors to experiment with alternative trust models.
 *  
 * 
 * Compilation (assuming ndn-cxx is installed):
 *   g++ -std=c++11 -o ndn_consumer ndn_consumer.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs ndn-cxx)
