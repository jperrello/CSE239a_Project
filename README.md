# Deferred Retrieval in PBACN-ICN

Our goal is to implement deferred retrieval in the context of PBACN-ICN, and modify how interest packets are fetched to obscure traffic patterns and prevent correlation attacks.

---

## Step 1: Choosing a Programming Language and Simulation Framework

Since this project is related to network routing and security, we needed to pick a language and framework that can handle:
1. Network Packet Simulation for interest packets and PBACN routing
2. Event-driven scheduling (the goal of deferred retrieval)
3. Performance testing

The choice we ended up going through with was **Python and Custom Event-Driven Simulation**.  
The benefits for this method are as follows:
1. This method is easier to prototype than C++ or OMNeT++.
2. Python queue structures allow for simple simulation of interest packets and deferred retrieval.

If we need to scale up later in the quarter, we can integrate this code into **ndnSIM** because Python allows for that interface.

---

## Step 2: Defining the Baseline

The baseline for this project should include:
1. Simulation of a basic ICN network with interest packets and PBACN routing.
2. Deferred retrieval, also known as randomly delay the fetching of interest packets.
3. Compare the two cases:
   - Without deferred retrieval
   - With deferred retrieval
4. Measure traffic correlation by checking whether fetching patterns are predictable.

## Explanation of Current Code

### `InterestPacket` Class:
Represents a request for content with a timestamp.

### `DeferredRetrievalSimulator` Class:
- **send_interest()**: A user sends an interest packet, which is scheduled for retrieval with a random delay. Given of course the packet isn't in the cache already.
- **process_fetches()**: Fetches interest packets based on the current time. Also simulates ICN nodes and caches.
- **run_simulation()**: Simulates a sequence of interest requests with deferred retrieval.
- **analyze_security()**: Stores the delay for each user's fetch request, and outputs delay data for each user.

We also added plotting functionality for a histogram of fetch delays to visualize how well traffic is obfuscated.  
This is mainly for testing as Joey likes to see data visualized on a graph.

## Why This Baseline Works

- We are able to effectively analyze how retrieval times vary between Immediate and Deferred Fetching.
- We successfully achieved traffic pattern obfuscation because requests are sent at known times, but retrievals are delayed randomly, breaking timing correlation.
- Fetch delays are widely spread, making it hard for an adversary to correlate traffic.
- We simulated ICNâ€™s core advantage of reducing redundant network traffic through the use of ICN cache implementation.
- Additionally, through the use of caches, traffic is harder to correlate because some packets never go through the network.

## Next Steps

We need to scale this to realistic network simulations. We plan on using **ndnSIM** for this.

## Setting up the Docker Container

to build:   `docker build -t ndnsim-with-sim`
to run:     `docker run --rm ndnsim-with-sim`


Optionally, to run with visualization enabled:

1. First, start an X11 server on your machine. In Windows, install and run **VcXsrv** (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
2. Then run the Docker container with X11 port forwarding enabled:  
`docker run -it --env DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/temp/.X11-unix ndnsim-with-sim`

## Using the Docker Container to run an experiment

Prepare the container to run experiments first
`./waf configure` optionally to use the built in examples add `--enable-examples`
then use `./waf` to compile
now to run an experiment
`./waf run=<experiment>`, for example: `./waf run=ndn-simple`
to run an experiment with visualization using X11 run the experiment with the option enabled
`./waf run=<experiment> --vis`
